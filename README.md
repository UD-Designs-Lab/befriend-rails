# BefriendRails

The app is in development stage. To report a bug or suggest a feature please feel free to [create an issue(s)](https://github.com/UD-Designs-Lab/befriend-rails/issues/new)

# Getting Started

To start testing this web service, you need to have `ruby 2.6.3`, `MySQL` and `Rails 6.0` installed on your Mac or PC.
It's also important noting that I preferred using `jbuilder` to `Active Model Serializers` for json handling.

- Clone this repository
- `cd` into the folder
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `rails db:create && rails db:migrate`
- Run `rails server`

## Register/Login

- Register -`POST /users/`
- Login - `POST /sessions/`
  ```json
  {
    "user": {
      "email": "johndore@some_email.com",
      "username": "johndore",
      "password": "somepassword"
    }
  }
  ```

2. Get the current user:

   ` GET /sessions/current_user/`

3. Get all the users of the App:

   `GET /users/`

## Posts/Stories

1. Create a post

   `POST /posts/`

   ```json
   {
     "body": "some amazing story you ever want to share with your connections",
     "image": "image url",
     "reply_status": "everyone"
   }
   ```

   **NOTE**: `reply_status` is defaulted to `everyone` so it MUST be included on every Json input. What `everyone` does is it makes the post commentable by anybody. To restrict who can comment on your post use `people_you_know` instead. It is also worth noting that, the "image" option when creating a post(s) is OPTIONAL and integrating `Cloudinary` into the app for image storage and stuff is a work in progress.

2. UPDATE a Post

   `PUT /posts/${post_id}/`

   ```json
   {
     "body": "Make some changes",
     "image": "image url",
     "reply_status": "everyone"
   }
   ```

3. DELETE a post/

   `DELETE /posts/${post_id}/`

4. SHOW a post by an individual user (including all reactions and comments on the post).

   `GET /posts/${uuid}/`

   **NOTE**: To get uuid execute `GET /users/$username}/` and extract the same under your desired post block.

5. SHOW all the app userâ€™s posts, reposts, comments and reactions by individual user

   `GET /users/${username}/`

## Reposts

1. Create a repost of a story
   `POST /reposts/${repost_id}/reposts`

   ```json
   {
     "repost": {
       "body": "Some quote/comment why you want to reshare story"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Create a repost on a repost
   `POST /reposts/${repost_id}/reposts`
